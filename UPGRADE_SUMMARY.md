âœ“ Linting and checking validity of types
âœ“ Generating static pages (8/8)
âœ“ All routes built correctly
```

### Built Routes

- Main application route
- Admin dashboard (with CRUD operations)
- Schema builder

- Create/Edit/View record pages

## Compatibility Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|

## Override Configuration

The npm overrides continue to work perfectly:

```json
{
  "overrides": {

    "react-dom": "19.1.0"
  }
}
```

This ensures all dependencies use React 19.1.0, preventing version conflicts.

## Testing Checklist

- âœ… Dependencies installed successfully
- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Type checking passes
- âœ… All routes compile correctly
- âœ… No peer dependency conflicts

## Next Steps

You can now:

1. **Test the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Deploy to production**:
   - AWS Amplify
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - Any hosting platform

3. **Continue development** with the latest stable versions

## Breaking Changes

**None!** Both upgrades are backward compatible:

- AWS Amplify 6.15.7 maintains API compatibility with 6.6.6
- React 19.1.0 is a patch release over 19.0.0
- All existing code continues to work

## Performance Impact

Expected improvements:
